The annoying light is a task designened for testing the SGOMS architecture
It includes the ability to run situated and ordered planning units
and it can be interupted, in which case it will finish the unit task it is doing and switch planning units appropriately

This is an SGOMS model of an android phone game which can be found here:

but it has an option to run a planning unit in a faster way
